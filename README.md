Adapter for mounting GreenPAK5 (SLG4653X) to DIP 20

Since Silego now sells DIP-20 boards for fast prototyping (http://www.silego.com/buy/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=61&products_id=508) there is no longer a need for those boards.

## SLG4653X PCB ##
Project Sil contains a DIP-20 sized PCB with a mounting place for SLG4653X and a 0603 capacitor.

## DIP-20 Programming adapter ##
